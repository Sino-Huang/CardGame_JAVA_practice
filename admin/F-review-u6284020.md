Review Comments:

1. The logic of task 5 is quite clear and staright-forward. It follows the frame and eliminates all the wrong possibilities step by step.

2. For all loops, he wrote corresponding comments to make the code more readable.

3. The program decomposition appropriate because you can see he use task 5's ismovelegal function in task 6 to determine valid sequence.

4. It follows java code convention and the style consistent throughout.

5. There is no error in his code and it could pass all the test and compile very well, i just made some rearrangement to first half part of his code to combine several loops together.
