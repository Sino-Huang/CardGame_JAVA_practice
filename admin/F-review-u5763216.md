Review Comments:

1. makePlacement implements the simple placement viewer. He 
used the javaFX to show all the cards from the string 
sequence and all the png files were made by himself by 
javaFX. Given the placement string, the cards are shown on 
the window.

2. The code is well-documented. All the methods have clear
comments that which function are realised.

3. This program is decomposition appropriate. The makePlacement
method is the main method to realize function while getEmptySpace
and getIndex are the methods which implement the functions 
that are used in the makePlacement method, which is clear
to understand.

4. It follows Java code conventions and it is style consistent 
throughout. There are three methods through this code which
are makePlacement, getEmptySpace and getIndex and all of 
the methods are named properly meanwhile all the variables
throughout the code are named properly. The code he made is
style consistent.
